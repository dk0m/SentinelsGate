Fetching System Call Service Numbers From The Control Flow Guard Function Table.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to [MDSec](https://www.mdsec.co.uk) for their detailed and amazing article about [Resolving System Service Numbers Using Exception Directory](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2022/04/resolving-system-service-numbers-using-the-exception-directory/), Due to them not implementing the first way of fetching System Call Service Numbers (The Guard CF Way), I decided to make it on my own.
